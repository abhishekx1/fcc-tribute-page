            <h3 id="tribute">Tributes</h3>
            <p id="tribute-text">On August 28, 2020, a Change.org petition was started, seeking to replace a Confederate
                monument in his
                hometown of Anderson with a statue of Boseman; it collected more than 50,000 signatures in less than a
                week, surpassing its original goal of 15,000 signatures.[182] Henry McMaster, the Governor of South
                Carolina, ordered the Statehouse flags be lowered to half-staff on August 30 in honor of Boseman, who
                was born and raised in the state. ABC (which, like Marvel Entertainment, is owned by Disney) aired a
                commercial-free version of Black Panther, followed by a special about Boseman's life and work titled
                Chadwick Boseman â€” A Tribute for a King on the same day. Also aired on August 30 was the 2020 MTV Video
                Music Awards; the ceremony was dedicated to Boseman. On September 24, 2020, Disney unveiled a mural
                titled King Chad, by artist Nikkolas Smith dedicated to Boseman at Downtown Disney in Anaheim,
                California. In February 2021, another mural dedicated to Boseman was painted at Trilith Studios in
                Fayetteville, Georgia, by artist Brandon Sadler. Following his Best Actor win over Boseman at the
                Academy Awards in April 2021, Anthony Hopkins said, "I want to pay tribute to Chadwick Boseman, who was
                taken from us far too early, and again thank you all very much."

                Boseman is also memorialized in the 2020 video game Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales. The game
                includes an after-credits message dedicating it in memory of Boseman, as well as a street called
                Boseman Way on 42nd Street; the number 42 bears significance in the Miles Morales universe as well
                as referring to Boseman's portrayal of Jackie Robinson. A Wakandan flag also appears. Amazon also
                made Black Panther comic titles available for free on its ComiXology platform in the wake of
                Boseman's death. On November 29, 2020, Marvel changed the studio's logo animation in the opening of
                Black Panther on Disney+ to include images of Boseman from the film, as well as his appearances in
                Captain America: Civil War, Avengers: Infinity War, and Avengers: Endgame, to honor what would have
                been Boseman's 44th birthday.
